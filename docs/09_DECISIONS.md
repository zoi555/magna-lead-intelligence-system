# Decisions — Magna Lead Intelligence System

## ADR-0001 — Use Project Operating System v2 before coding

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Context

This project is business-critical and has many moving parts: NetSuite data, CRM import, external APIs, scoring, compliance, and auditability.

### Decision

Use the documentation-first Project Operating System v2 before implementation.

### Reason

Lost project history and undocumented decisions are a major risk.

## ADR-0002 — Platform-first discovery, Google fallback

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

Delivery platform discovery is primary. Google Places API is fallback only.

### Reason

The earlier Google-only attempt produced invalid/dead data. Platform listings prove current trading activity.

## ADR-0003 — Deterministic pipeline, not runtime LLM

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

No vector DB, agent framework, or runtime LLM in MVP scoring/matching.

### Reason

The system must be cheap, auditable, explainable, and maintainable.

## ADR-0004 — Manual Magna Sales Pro upload in MVP

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

CRM upload remains manual and reviewed in MVP.

### Reason

A bad automated write creates sales embarrassment at scale. Manual review is cheap protection.

## ADR-0005 — Address-based FSA and Companies House matching

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

Match by physical address first, not brand name.

### Reason

Brand-name matching fails for virtual kitchens and can create false positives.

## ADR-0006 — In-house Companies House parser instead of DataLedger

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

Use public Companies House filings and parse in-house.

### Reason

Underlying data is public and many target companies do not disclose turnover anyway.

## ADR-0007 — Supabase UAT and production must be separate

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

Separate UAT and production databases.

### Reason

Lead/contact data, audit logs, and scoring decisions must not be mixed between test and live environments.

## ADR-0008 — Trigger-flagged leads need same-day routing

Date: 2026-07-09  
Status: Accepted

### Decision

New business, ownership change, and review complaint triggers bypass normal weekly batch.

### Reason

Buying signals decay quickly; a week-late lead is often just a historical footnote with a phone number.
