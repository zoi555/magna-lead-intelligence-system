# Bugs and Fixes — Magna Lead Intelligence System

No implementation bugs yet because no code has been built.

## Historical design fixes from discovery phase

These are design corrections, not app bug fixes:

| ID | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| DESIGN-FIX-001 | Google Places-only discovery produced invalid/dead data | Platform-first discovery, Google fallback only |
| DESIGN-FIX-002 | Business-name matching produced false positives | Address-based FSA/Companies House matching |
| DESIGN-FIX-003 | Manual review queue risked becoming too heavy | 80%+ matches auto-ignored with full audit trail |
| DESIGN-FIX-004 | Paid enrichment could run too early | Free filters before paid calls |
| DESIGN-FIX-005 | Turnover data unavailable for many small firms | Review volume used as size proxy |

## 2026-07-11 — Vertical Slice 001 build fixes

- **BUG:** `scripts/export-project-summary.ts` had an unterminated string literal
  (`parts.join('` with a raw newline). Because `tsconfig` includes `**/*.ts`, this failed
  `next build` type-check. **Fix:** `parts.join('\n')`. Restores the script's intent; unblocks build.
- **BUG:** `listRunIds()` in `src/lib/pipeline/run-store.ts` matched `<run>.records.json`, so
  `leads:status` loaded the records array as a run state and crashed on `status.toUpperCase()`.
  **Fix:** also exclude `*.records.json` from the run-id listing. Verified `npm run leads:status`.

## 2026-07-15 — Map interaction functional pass (`@geospatial/map` v0.1.2)

- **BUG:** A roads rendered as fuzzy/dashed sub-pixel hairlines. **Fix:** raised road widths
  above ~0.9px per class and added casing+solid layer pairs for motorway/A/B with round
  caps/joins and no dash arrays (`roadRules.ts`, `createMapStyle.ts`). A roads now solid;
  hierarchy preserved (primary A split from other A by `primary_route`).
- **BUG:** Road labels stayed visible when their roads were disabled (decoupled). **Fix:**
  coupled `label-a-num` / `label-b-num` / `label-road-name` visibility to the road geometry
  setting in `layerVisibilityForProfile`. Motorway numbers remain the locked exception.
  Covered by new package tests.
- **BUG:** Postcode-sector checkbox had no visible effect (four independent postcode toggles
  fought each other). **Fix:** replaced with a single `postcodes.mode` study-mode selector
  (`off|area|district|sector|full`); only the active level's labels + point interaction show.
- **BUG:** Selection highlight was indistinguishable from the run territory. **Fix:**
  selection is now blue (`#2563eb`), territory stays orange (`#ea580c`), hover is dark —
  three visually distinct states. Escape clears the selection.
- Verified: package typecheck + tests green; AspectLead typecheck + retained tests + build
  green; routes 200; no asset 404s (`docs/56_MAP_INTERACTION_FUNCTIONAL_PASS.md`).
