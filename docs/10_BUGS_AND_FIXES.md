# Bugs and Fixes — Magna Lead Intelligence System

No implementation bugs yet because no code has been built.

## Historical design fixes from discovery phase

These are design corrections, not app bug fixes:

| ID | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| DESIGN-FIX-001 | Google Places-only discovery produced invalid/dead data | Platform-first discovery, Google fallback only |
| DESIGN-FIX-002 | Business-name matching produced false positives | Address-based FSA/Companies House matching |
| DESIGN-FIX-003 | Manual review queue risked becoming too heavy | 80%+ matches auto-ignored with full audit trail |
| DESIGN-FIX-004 | Paid enrichment could run too early | Free filters before paid calls |
| DESIGN-FIX-005 | Turnover data unavailable for many small firms | Review volume used as size proxy |
